# Flocking

## Description
This project is a an attempt at creating Reynold's flocking behaviors in unreal. Currently able to spawn ~500 boids at 60fps, and ~1000 boids at 30fps on my laptop. Just added multithreading and working on adding a octree for spatial optimization. It would have definitely been better if I had done parallel proccessing on the GPU, but unreals documentation for compute shaders is extremely lacking.
