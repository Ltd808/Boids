# Flocking

## Description
This project is a an attempt at creating Reynold's flocking behaviors in unreal. I followed sebastian lagues video on boids in unity for the obstacle avoidance. Ive added parallel proccessing and I'm currently able to spawn ~600 boids at 60fps in editor on my laptop. It should be better when packaged, and I am working on adding an octree for spatial optimization.
