# Boids

## Description
For this project I implemented Reynold's flocking behaviors in unreal with multithreading and spatial optimization. On my laptop I can spawn 800 boids at 60fps, and 1600 boids at 30fps.

## Future goals
* Add targetBP for setting boid target dynamically
* Move parallel proccessing to the GPU.
